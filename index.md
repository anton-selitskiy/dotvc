## Abstract
In this work, we address the voice conversion (VC) task using
a vector-based interface. To align audio embeddings between speakers,
we employ discrete optimal transport mapping. Our evaluation results
demonstrate the high quality and effectiveness of this method. Additionally,
we show that applying discrete optimal transport as a post-processing step
in audio generation can lead to the incorrect classification of synthetic
audio as real.
